\label{sec:conclusion}

By leveraging a sparse voxel map and integrating roto-translational branching with GPU-accelerated batched processing, 3D-BBS effectively balances localization accuracy with computational efficiency. The ablation studies conducted on key configuration parameters provide valuable insights into optimizing the algorithm for different scenarios, highlighting the importance of scan range, resolution, and point cloud downsampling in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the integration of RGB images showcases the potential for multimodal data fusion to enhance localization robustness. Future work can focus on improving the depth estimates of images to generate more accurate point clouds, that can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR scans.
