\begin{enumerate}

\item Construction of high-definition 3D map using KISS-ICP for precise alignment of LiDAR scans.

\item LiDAR-to-LiDAR global localization using 3D Bag of Binary Words (3D-BBS) for efficient feature extraction and the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm for optimized scan matching.

\item Projection of depth maps computed using Depth Anything v2 to point clouds, used for alignment and localization.

\end{enumerate}
